## Portfolio Introduction

### Who Am I?

Hello, my name is Nicholas Botorog, and I am from Romania.
My technology journey began with a passion for solving real-world problems through coding, which led me to explore both front-end and back-end development. Now I work as a Software Engineer at American Express, where I continue to grow my expertise and contribute to impactful projects in the tech industry.

### Why you do what you do

I’ve always been deeply passionate about creating projects that make a tangible impact on our daily lives and address real-world challenges. My coding journey began with JavaScript on Udemy, where I quickly fell in love with the limitless possibilities unlocked by just a few lines of code. This spark of curiosity led me to dive even deeper into the world of programming through General Assembly, where I immersed myself in a comprehensive full-stack development program.

From building simple applications to tackling complex challenges, each project strengthened my resolve to use technology as a tool for innovation and problem-solving. What excites me most is the creative process—transforming ideas into practical solutions that can genuinely improve people’s lives. Whether it's streamlining a tedious task or building something entirely novel, the thrill of crafting solutions drives me to keep learning and growing.

Today, my hunger for innovation and creating meaningful projects is stronger than ever. I’m not just driven by the technical challenges but also by the opportunity to leave a positive mark on the world through technology. For me, coding isn’t just a skill—it’s a gateway to turning dreams into reality.


### Your areas of interest
I am deeply passionate about full-stack development, with a particular emphasis on back-end technologies. While I enjoy tapping into my creative side through front-end development, my true drive lies in expanding my back-end expertise and tackling more technically challenging projects.
